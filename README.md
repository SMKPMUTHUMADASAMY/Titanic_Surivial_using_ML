Titanic Survival Analysis using Machine Learning 
🔍 Objective:
To demonstrate the application of supervised machine learning (classification) on real-world data and extract meaningful insights that can aid decision-making in similar survival prediction scenarios.

Introduction:
📊 Titanic Survival Analysis using Machine Learning - Random Forest Classifier
This project involves predictive analysis on the Titanic dataset to determine the likelihood of passenger survival using the Random Forest Classifier, a robust ensemble learning algorithm. The goal is to build an accurate classification model that can predict survival outcomes based on features such as age, gender, class, fare, and more.

✅ Key Features:
Cleaned and preprocessed the Titanic dataset.

Explored data through visualization and statistical analysis.

Engineered features for improved model performance.

Built and tuned a Random Forest Classifier to predict survival.

Evaluated model accuracy using classification metrics (confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier, train_test_split, metrics)
