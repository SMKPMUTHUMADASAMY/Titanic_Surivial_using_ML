# Titanic_Surivial_using_ML
This project involves predictive analysis on the Titanic dataset to determine the likelihood of passenger survival using the Random Forest Classifier, a robust ensemble learning algorithm. The goal is to build an accurate classification model that can predict survival outcomes based on features such as age, gender, class, fare, and more.
